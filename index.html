Wise men say <br>
Only fools rush in <br>
But I can't help falling in love with you <br>
<br>
Shall I stay? <br>
Would it be a sin <br>
If I can't help falling in love with you? <br>
Like a river flows <br>
Surely to the sea <br>
<br>
Darling, so it goes <br>
Some things are meant to be <br>
<br>
Take my hand <br>
Take my whole life, too <br>
For I can't help falling in love with you <br>
Like a river flows <br>
Surely to the sea <br>
Darling, so it goes <br>
Some things are meant to be <br>
<br>
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you <br>
For I can't help falling in love with you <br>
For I can't help falling in love with you........<br>
